# WebcamSetZoom
This python script was created using AI. The camera name is hard coded into the script, and the zoom level is set by the first parameter passed to it.

The zoom level passed to it is an integer, not a percentage. To see your cameras range of values, check the Video Properties of your webcam and adjust the slider to see what integers are valid.

# Usage example
python ./WebcamSetZoom.py 100
